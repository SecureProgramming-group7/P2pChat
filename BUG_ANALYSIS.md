# P2P Chat Application ‚Äî Issue Analysis and Fix Plan

## üêõ Issues Identified

### 1. Online Members Display

* **Symptom:** The online members list always shows only one member.
* **Cause:** Member info isn‚Äôt properly broadcast when a node joins, or the de-duplication logic is faulty.

### 2. Duplicate Messages

* **Symptom:** When 8081 sends a message, 8080 receives it twice.
* **Cause:** The forwarding logic sends duplicates, possibly because:

  * The message is both processed locally and forwarded.
  * De-duplication is missing in the forwarding path.

### 3. Self Private Message

* **Symptom:** A user can start a private chat with themselves.
* **Cause:** The user list includes the local node‚Äôs ID and doesn‚Äôt filter it out.

### 4. Username Display

* **Symptom:** Usernames appear as long numeric strings.
* **Cause:** The full node ID is used as the display name instead of a shortened, friendly label.

## üîß Remediation Plan

### 1. Fix Node ID Display

* Provide user-friendly display names (e.g., `Node_8080`, `Node_8081`).
* Keep the full node ID internally for identification.

### 2. Eliminate Duplicate Messages

* Add a message de-duplication mechanism.
* Correct the forwarding flow to avoid double-processing.

### 3. Correct the Members List

* Filter out the local node from the list.
* Repair join/leave broadcasting logic.

### 4. Improve UX

* Use the port number as the displayed username.
* Attach message IDs to prevent duplicates.
* Improve online presence/state management.
