# **Complete File Transfer Implementation Guide**

## 🎉 Feature Complete

I’ve implemented **full file transfer** for the P2P chat app—sending and receiving real files now works end to end.

## 📋 What’s New

### 1) Actual File Data Transfer

* ✅ Socket-based file transfer service
* ✅ Multithreaded concurrent transfers
* ✅ Transfer progress display
* ✅ Automatic error handling and retries

### 2) Transfer Flow

1. **Sender** selects a file and initiates a request
2. **Receiver** gets a confirmation dialog to accept/decline
3. **If accepted**, chooses a save location
4. **Transfer starts** automatically
5. **Progress** is shown in real time
6. **On completion**, both sides are notified of the result

### 3) Technical Implementation

#### `FileTransferService`

* Dedicated service for file transfers
* Uses a separate port (main port + 1000)
* Supports concurrent transfers
* Monitors transfer progress
  
#### File Transfer Protocol

```
Header format (send): SEND:sessionId:fileName:fileSize:savePath
Data transfer: chunked with an 8KB buffer
Progress display: update every 80KB
```

## 🔧 How to Use

### Sending a File

1. Click the **“File”** button in the chat window.
2. Select the file to send.
3. Confirm the target (group or direct message).
4. Wait for the recipient to accept.
5. Transfer starts automatically.

### Receiving a File

1. A file transfer request dialog appears.
2. Review the file info (name, size).
3. Click **“OK”** to accept.
4. Choose a save location.
5. Receiving starts automatically.

## 📁 Save Location

### Default Path

```
<user home>/P2PChat_Downloads/
```

### Custom Location

* Choose any save path when accepting a file
* Auto-rename to avoid overwriting
* Automatically creates needed directories

## 🚀 Performance Features

### Transfer Performance

* **Buffer size:** 8 KB
* **Progress updates:** every 80 KB
* **Concurrency:** multiple files in parallel
* **Memory optimization:** streaming I/O, no large in-memory buffers

### Error Handling

* Auto-detect network interruptions
* “File not found” prompts
* Low disk space warnings
* Automatic failure notifications

## 🔍 Debug Info

During transfer, detailed logs appear in the console:

```
[File Transfer] Starting send to Node-xxx (localhost:9081)
[File Transfer] Progress: 25% (2048/8192 bytes)
[File Transfer] Progress: 50% (4096/8192 bytes)
[File Transfer] Progress: 75% (6144/8192 bytes)
[File Transfer] File sent: example.png (8192 bytes)
```

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Port Allocation

* **Main communication ports:** 8080, 8081, 8082, …
* **File transfer ports:** 9080, 9081, 9082, … (main port + 1000)

### Service Components

1. **Node:** Primary node service
2. **MessageRouter:** Message routing
3. **FileTransferService:** File transfer service
4. **PeerConnection:** Peer connection management

### Data Flow

```
Sender → file request message → Receiver
Receiver → accept/decline message → Sender
Sender → file data stream → Receiver
```

## ⚠️ Notes

### File Size Limit

* Current limit: 100 MB
* Configurable in code
* Large transfers take longer

### Network Requirements

* P2P connectivity must be healthy
* Firewalls may block file transfer ports
* Testing on the same network is recommended

### Security Tips

* Verify the sender’s identity before accepting
* Be extra cautious with executables
* Scan received files with antivirus software

## 🔮 Future Improvements

### Short-term

* [ ] Resume interrupted transfers
* [ ] Display transfer speed
* [ ] Batch file transfers
* [ ] Transfer history

### Long-term

* [ ] Encrypted file transfers
* [ ] Compression-based optimization
* [ ] Cloud storage integration
* [ ] Mobile support

## 🎯 Test Recommendations

### Basic Tests

1. Launch two node instances
2. Connect the nodes
3. Send a small file (<1 MB)
4. Verify file integrity

### Stress Tests

1. Send a large file (near 100 MB)
2. Transfer multiple files concurrently
3. Test recovery from network interruptions
4. Run long-duration stability tests
