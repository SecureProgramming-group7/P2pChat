# P2P Chat — File Transfer Fix Summary Report

## 🎯 Fix Status

### ✅ Group Chat File Transfer — Fully Resolved

**Status:** Working as expected
**Verification:** Your logs show the full transfer flow:

```
[File Transfer] File sent: c60e2645-260f-4281-94b1-c90262b7a7c0.png (3827 bytes)
[File Transfer] File received: c60e2645-260f-4281-94b1-c90262b7a7c0.png (3827 bytes)
[File Transfer] File saved successfully, size: 3827 bytes
```

### ✅ Private Chat File Transfer — Recently Fixed

**Issue:** “Accepted file transfer” appeared, but no actual transfer occurred
**Cause:** `acceptFileTransfer` was a simplified stub and did not start the transfer
**Fix:** Implemented the full file transfer logic

## 🔧 What Changed

### 1) Address Parsing Enhancements

* **Problem:** Addresses like `localhost/127.0.0.1:9081` caused parsing failures
* **Fix:** Added robust handling for complex address formats
* **Result:** Correct parsing across different address representations

### 2) Expanded Debug Logging

* **Added:** Detailed logs for each transfer step
* **Includes:** Connection state, address parsing, transfer progress, and completion
* **Result:** Easier diagnosis and clearer runtime visibility

### 3) Private Chat File Transfer

* **Problem:** `acceptFileTransfer` had no real implementation
* **Fix:** Added end-to-end logic to locate the file and initiate the actual transfer
* **Flow:** Accept request → locate file → start transfer

## 📋 Latest Code Behaviors

### Group Chat File Transfer Flow

1. Choose a file → call `fileTransferService.sendFile()` directly
2. Establish the file-transfer connection
3. Send file bytes
4. Show progress and completion status

### Private Chat File Transfer Flow

1. Choose a file → send `FILE_REQUEST` message
2. Receiver confirms → calls `acceptFileTransfer()`
3. Locate the file to be sent → start transfer
4. Complete transfer and save the file
