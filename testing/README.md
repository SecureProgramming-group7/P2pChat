# P2P Chat Testing Tools

This directory contains concise and reliable test scripts for testing the functionality of the P2P chat application.

##  Quick Start

### For Windows Users

1. **Check the System**:

```cmd
check.bat
```

2. **Test the CLI Version** (recommended to start with this):

```cmd
cli-test.bat
```

3. **Test the GUI Version** (requires JavaFX):

```cmd
gui-test.bat
```

### For Linux/Mac Users

1. **Test the CLI Version**:

```bash
./cli-test.sh
```

2. **Test the GUI Version**:

```bash
./gui-test.sh
```

##  Script Descriptions

### `check.bat`

* Checks Java installation
* Checks JAR and class files
* Tests the CLI version
* Checks JavaFX availability

### `cli-test.bat/.sh`

* Launches the CLI version of the P2P chat nodes
* Supports 1â€“3 nodes
* Does not require JavaFX, ensuring maximum compatibility
* Runs each node in a separate command-line window

### `gui-test.bat/.sh`

* Launches the GUI version of the P2P chat nodes
* Supports 1â€“3 nodes
* Requires JavaFX support
* Runs each node in a separate GUI window

##  Usage Instructions

### CLI Version Testing

1. Run `cli-test.bat`
2. Choose the number of nodes to start
3. In each command-line window, use the following commands:

   * `send Hello!` â€“ send a group chat message
   * `status` â€“ view connection status
   * `list` â€“ list connected nodes
   * `quit` â€“ exit the node

### GUI Version Testing

1. Run `gui-test.bat`
2. Choose the number of nodes to start
3. In each GUI window:

   * Send group chat messages
   * Right-click on a user in the list to start a private chat
   * Use the file transfer feature
   * Manually connect to other nodes

##  Troubleshooting

### Script Crashes

* Run `check.bat` to check the system status
* Make sure you are running the scripts in the `testing/` directory
* Ensure the project is compiled: `mvn clean package`

### JavaFX Issues

* If the GUI version does not work, use the CLI version instead
* Install a Java distribution that includes JavaFX: [https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk-fx](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk-fx)

### File Not Found

* Ensure you are running the scripts in the `testing/` directory
* Run `mvn clean package` to recompile the project

##  Testing Recommendations

1. **First-Time Testing**: Run `check.bat` to verify the system setup
2. **Stable Testing**: Use `cli-test.bat` for basic functionality testing
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: If JavaFX is available, use `gui-test.bat` for full feature testing
4. **Network Testing**: Launch multiple nodes to test P2P communication

## ðŸŽ¯ Testing Objectives

These scripts help verify:

* P2P network connections
* Group chat message delivery
* Private chat functionality (GUI version)
* File transfer (GUI version)
* Node discovery and routing
* Secure encrypted communication
* Network failure recovery
